## Introduction

üöÄ LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding problems and improving algorithmic skills. Many of the problems on LeetCode require knowledge of fundamental algorithms and data structures. This repository aims to provide a curated collection of these algorithms to help you tackle LeetCode problems with confidence.

## Algorithms

Here's a list of some of the standard algorithms covered in this repository:

- [Sieve of Eratosthenes](algorithms/sieve_of_eratosthenes.java): A fast algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.
- [Depth-First Search (DFS)](algorithms/depth_first_search.java): A graph traversal algorithm for exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](algorithms/breadth_first_search.java): A graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices at the same level before moving to the next level.
- [Binary Search](algorithms/binary_search.java): An efficient search algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array.
- [Dynamic Programming](algorithms/dynamic_programming.java): A technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems.
- [Greedy Algorithms](algorithms/greedy_algorithms.java): A strategy for making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.
- [...and more](algorithms/)

Feel free to explore and use these algorithms to solve LeetCode problems more effectively.

## How to Use

You can clone this repository and use the algorithms provided in your LeetCode solutions. Each algorithm is contained in a separate file within the [algorithms](algorithms/) directory. Simply copy the relevant algorithm code and integrate it into your solution as needed.
